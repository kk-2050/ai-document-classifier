# AI Document Classifier

An AI-powered document classification workflow built with **n8n** and **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**.

This tool automatically analyzes text content and classifies documents into categories such as Invoice, Resume, Contract, Report, and Email — returning structured results in JSON format.

## What It Does

Send any document text to the webhook endpoint, and the workflow will return:

- **Category** — Document type (Invoice, Resume, Contract, Report, Email, Other)
- **Confidence** — Classification confidence level (high / medium / low)
- **Summary** — One-sentence description of the document
- **Key Entities** — Up to 3 important names, dates, or amounts extracted from the text
